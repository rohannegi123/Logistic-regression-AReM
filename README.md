The dataset contains temporal data from a Wireless Sensor Network worn by an actor performing the activities: bending, cycling, lying down, sitting, standing, walking.

The model will be used in predicting the activity performed by the user from time-series generated by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), according to the EvAAL competition technical annex ([Web Link]).
